## How did it Start?

Well we were at the park when we meet each other(we were friends alredy) and Skyjp(SkyJeanPirate) told me let start a company where we create only games. Well i was like yes and thenthought lets invite SupForest as he wil give us ideas and design sprites. So we set off on a Retro game making adventure. We used Scratch as a starting point and build up our devolopment platform.
